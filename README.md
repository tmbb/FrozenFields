## Frozen Fields Add-on for Anki

**Overview**

*Frozen Fields* allows you to conveniently sticky and unsticky a field right from the note editor:

This is a fork of the eponymous [add-on by tmbb](https://github.com/tmbb/FrozenFields).

New in this release are a number of shortcuts for controlling the state of your fields:

- <kbd>F9</kbd> – toggle field between frozen and unfrozen
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F9</kbd> – unfreeze all fields

You can customize these shortcuts by editing the script. A list of all possible key assignments can be found [here](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qt.html#Key-enum).

**Notes on this fork**

Initially I didn't plan on releasing this as a separate add-on (rather opting for my changes to be included in the main add-on branch), but seeing how tmbb's fantastic add-ons have all been taken down from AnkiWeb due to his [account troubles](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons/4950-my-addons-have-become-unavailable-after-account-removal) I decided to re-upload the Frozen Fields add-on with my modifications already applied.

To tmbb: Please feel free to contact me on GitHub if you are planning on re-uploading your add-ons, so that I can take this down from AnkiWeb. There's no sense in maintaining yet another fork when the changes could very well just be merged into the main branch.

**Limitations**

- toggling the state of a field via the mouse will cause the editor to jump around in some cases

**Source code**

The add-on's source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/Glutanimate/FrozenFields). Bug reports and pull requests are welcome!
